### Some targets have data which is useful for validation

HAT-P-1b has an extra bright target on the detector
GJ436 has data on a non-existent planet
Ã¥Andrews planet data could be useful for this


### To Try:

Run stare mode stellar spectra? Why is the transmission spectrum breaking for stare mode? Would be nice to add maybe.
        Nope it's useless
Run some splined transmission spectra for e.g. K2-18
Run a model for e.g. K2-18 that stacks all the design matrices and retrieves the mean with a spline
Check spline works with knots specified (not nknots)
