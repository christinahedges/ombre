# To Do

This is my list of things that need to be added to `ombre`

## Features
- Add multiple transiting planets for TRAPPIST-1
- Phase curve modeling for supplementary data and WFC3 data
- Speed up linear algebra with batches
- Add a basic stare mode version

## Packaging
- Add README/docs landing page
- API Documentation
- Citation stuff
- Tutorials

Bugs:
-----

* Stellar spectrum should save literature and best fit effective temperature
* Add gradient of xshift and yshift to wavelength dependent model
